The direct current machine is a rotating machine that transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. It is reversible and can work both as a generator (dynamo) and as a motor.

The dynamo transform mechanical energy into electrical energy.

The dynamo's operating principle makes use of the law of induced voltage in a conductor moving in a magnetic field.

## DC motors components
The direct current machine comprises:
- a *stator*, where the magnetic poles are placed;
- a *rotor*, where the coils are wound;
- a *commutator*, coaxial with the rotor, made up of $z$ segments insulated from each other. The winding coils are connected to the segments;
- *brushes*, made of sintered[^1] copper-graphite powder. These are placed in contact with the commutator segments in order to take up in the voltage.

[^1]: Sintering is the processo of compacting and forming a soldi mass of material by pressure or heat without melting it to the point of liquefaction.
