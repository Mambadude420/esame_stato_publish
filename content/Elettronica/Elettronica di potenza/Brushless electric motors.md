Brushless electric motors have all the regulatory advantages of DC motors without having the problem of brush wear.

Brushless motors need to be controlled by an electronic drive in order to function.

Considering the specific electricity supply, we have brushless DC and brushless AC motors.

Unlike DC and asynchronous motors, brushless motors have the *magnetic poles* on the rotor, obtained using permanent neodymium-iron-boron or rare-earth magnets with high flux density.

Brushless DC motors use *trapezoidal field* distribution.

Electronic actuators allow to switch stator windings currents to create rotating magnetic fields with controllable speed and intensity; this affects the control of rotor's position, yielded torque and engine speed.

Brushless motor control is generally obtained by *feedback loop control*: by means of sensors located in the engine, the angular position signal (and therefore the speed) and the torque signal are reported in a loop to check them with the reference values.
