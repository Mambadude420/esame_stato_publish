The induction, or asynchronous, motor is made up of a stator, where the primary windings are found, and a rotor which can be wound or squirrel-cage.

The asynchronous machine works by using the rotating field produced by the stator windings.

The three-phase rotating field is made using three coils displaced from each other by $120^\circ$ between them and supplying them with a symmetrical three-phase voltage system.

The rotating field can be obtained with a different number of poles, and it takes up an angular velocity $\omega_{1} = \frac{\omega}{p}$ where $p$ is the number of *pole pairs*, and $\omega$ is the supply frequency.

The slip $s$ is the ratio $s = \frac{{\omega_{1} - \omega_{2}}}{\omega_{1}}$.

The maximum torque value is proportional to the square of the supply voltage and inversely proportional to the inductance $L_{2}$. It is not however influenced by the value of $R_{2}$: the latter determines the slip $S_{M}$ where the torque is maximum.

The single-phase motor is made like a two-phase motor, having two coils displaced from each other by $90^\circ$. The two phases are supplied by the grid single-phase voltage, but one of the two is connected in series to a capacitor which produces a phase shift in the current.

The rotating field of the single-phase motor is elliptical.

The equivalenti circuit of the asynchronous motor is similar to that of the real transformer. The mechanical load is represented by a load resistance $R_{L}$ connected to the secondary:
$$
R_{L} = R_{2} \frac {1 - s} {s}
$$

The torque produced by the motor is proportional to the transmitted power.

A good efficiency is obtained:
- with low $R_{2}$ values
- with low $R_{1}$ values
- with low $P_{0}$ and $P_{m}$ values
