The magnetic levitation train (Maglev) is a vehicle that uses magnetic forces to travel at high speeds. Maglev trains float on an electromagnetic ?cushion? above a fixed track called a 'guideway', without touching it. Their speed is therefore not limited by the friction or vibration caused by contact with a track making them extremely energy-efficient and able to travel at over 500 kph.

Maglev trains have several other advantages. They produce almost no pollution and are extremely quiet. In addition, their guideways need little maintenance and, since they are raised and  comparatively narrow, have very little impact on the environment. Despite their speed, they are also safer than other transport since the high level of control makes collisions on the guideway virtually impossible.

There are two kinds of Maglev technology: electrodynamic and electromagnetic.

**Electrodynamic suspension** (EDS), developed mainly in Japan, uses magnetic repulsion. These trains employ superconducting magnets, cooled to extremely cold temperatures, which are placed on the bottom of the train. As the train moves, the magnets induce currents in wire coils set in the guideway. The opposing magnetic force, between the magnets and the induced currents, lifts the vehicle. The train runs on wheels until it gains enough speed to lift off the guideway and then travels about 10 centimeters above the guideway.

**Electromagnetic suspension** (EMS), developed in Germany uses magnetic attraction. The underside of an electromagnetic Maglev train carries electromagnets that ride beneath a T-shaped guideway. When current flows through the magnets, the are attracted upward to steel rails on the guideway.

Some engineers believe that Maglev trains, running through special tunnels where air resistance is reduced, could reach much faster speeds and eventually become the main form of ling-distance travel, overtaking air travel, At present the only commercially-operating high-speed Maglev link is between the city of Shanghai and its airport but there are other projects planned, mainly in Japan, Germany and the USA. The principal obstacle to development is the very high cost off constructing the guideways and other infrastructure over long distances. In addition, the increased velocity of conventional high-speed trains in recent years has made them more competitive with Maglev
