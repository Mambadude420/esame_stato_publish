AC motors developed when electricity from the mains, based on AC, became available in the early 20th century. The use of AC means that the direction of the flow inside the motor's electromagnet is automatically reversed and so there is no need for a commutator and brushed. This makes the AC motor simpler and more convenient. The speed depends on the frequency of the AC current.

The **AC induction motor** is the most commonly used for household appliances like washing machines and fans. It is relatively inexpensive, reliable and requires little maintenance. In this motor the stator, not the rotor, has the electric windings connected to the electricity supply. The stator induces and electric current in the rotor to make it an electromagnet. At the same time it creates a rotating magnetic field which pulls the rotor around.

A **three-phase AC motor** is a more powerful version for use, for example, in heavy machinery. It has three different windings, each connected separately to the electricity supply, placed around the circumference of the stator.

A **synchronous AC motor** operates in a similar way to an induction motor but it is more complex and designed to maintain a very consistent speed. This make it suitable for use in devices like clocks, CD players and computer hard drives. It is not suitable for operations requiring high torque.
