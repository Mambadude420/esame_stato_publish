Burning petrol to run cars creates air pollution as well as greenhouse gases which are causing limate change. It also wastes an important natural resource, oil, of which there are limited supplies in the world.

**Electric cars** appear to be the ideal alternative for future transport. They are quiet, create no pollution and are not dependent on import of foreign oil at fluctuating prices. Driver can simply plug in their cars and fill up with energy from their own homes.
The main problem is that need big heavy batteries. The batteries have to be continually recharged, which takes time, and this limits the distance that they can travel. Electric cars also need power stations to feed them with energy and the power stations themselves may be dependent on oil and create pollution.

**Solar cars** are not a realistic alternative since the amount of energy produced by their solar panels is not enough to run a car for most practical purposes.

**Fuel cell cars** could provide a solution to these problems. A fuel cell car produces its own electricity, does not need to be recharged and can travel as fari as it wants. Its only waste product is water. However, it is dependent on hydrogen as its fuel. At present it is expensive to produce this fuel and there is no network to supply it to drivers. There are great prospects for fuel cells but right now the technology is still experimental.

**Hybrid cars** appear to be a good compromise for present circumstances. It is trye that they require a supply of petrol and produce some pollution. In addition, having more complex systems, they are more expensive to buy and maintain than conventional cars. On the other hand, petrol consumption and pollution are much lower and, compared to standard electric cars, the distance they can travel is not limited by being completely dependent on batteries.
