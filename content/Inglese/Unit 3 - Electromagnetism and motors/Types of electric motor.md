Electric motors use the force of magnetism to transform electrical energy into mechanical energy.

A motor has two parts: the **rotor** which moves and the stator **which** is stationary. Usually the rotor revolves inside the stator and turns an axle which carries the mechanical energy to do  the work of the motor.

Normally the stator is a permanent magnet and the metal rotor has coils of wire wound around it. When an electric current passes through the wire, the rotor becomes an electromagnet. Its poles are attracted by the opposite poles of the stator and it begins to turn. To keep it turning it is necessary to continually change the poles of the electromagnet by constantly reversing the current flowing through the wire.

If **alternating current (AC)** from the mains is used, this reversal in direction happens automatically. The turning power of the motor is called 'torque'. The power is measured in watts and the speed in rpm (revolution per minute).
Speed and torque depend on the amount of electric current and voltage.
