A conventional car consists essentially of:
- a fuel tank for petrol or diesel, the source of the car's energy
- an engine which converts the fuel into mechanical energy. The engine has compartments called 'cylinders' where the fuel burns and produces hot gas, pushing pistons up and down
- a transmission system which uses the mechanical energy to make the car move. The pistons turn a rotating axle called a 'crankshaft' which then turns the wheels.

The main role of electricity is simply to start the engine, through the battery, and ignite the fuel, through electric sparking plugs.

An **electric car** works i a different way. Instead of a fuel tank there are large batteries which store the power. They have to ber regularly recharged by plugging the car into an electricity supply. Instead of a petrol engine there is an electric motor which takes energy from the battery and uses it to turn the axle.
Some electric cars have a different structure. They produce electricity from fuel cells instead of batteries. They produce electricity from fuel cells instead of batteries. They do not need to be recharged but must have a fuel tank containing hydrogen gas to feed the cell.
Experimental solar cars have large solar panels on the roof to charge the batteries.

**Hybrid cars** are a combination of conventional and electric. They have a small petrol engine which drives the car at high speeds on the open road. But they also have an electric motor and batteries used for lower speeds, especially in the city. The car can switch from one power system to the other. The motor also function as a generator to recharge the battery.
